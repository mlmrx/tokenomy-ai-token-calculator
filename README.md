# Tokenomy AI Toolkit

Tokenomy provides a suite of interactive tools for analyzing and optimizing large language model (LLM) workloads. The application is built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and Vite.

## Features

- **Token Calculator** – estimate token counts and costs for multiple models
- **Speed Simulator** – visualize token generation speeds across providers
- **Memory Calculator** – plan memory requirements for complex prompts
- **Energy Usage Estimator** – approximate environmental impact and electricity costs
- **AI Content Detector** – identify whether text was likely generated by an AI system. Now includes a simplified check for [Google SynthID](https://ai.google.dev/responsible/docs/safeguards/synthid) watermarks inspired by the [synthid-text](https://github.com/google-deepmind/synthid-text) project.
- **Additional utilities** – model comparison charts, tokenization info and prompt optimization tips

## Getting Started

1. Install Node.js and npm.
2. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Visit `http://localhost:8080` to view the app.

The AI news ticker fetches updates from `/ai-news.json` by default. You can
provide your own API endpoint by setting the `VITE_NEWS_API_URL` environment
variable when starting the dev server or building the project.

### Other Scripts

- `npm run build` – create an optimized production build
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint on the project
