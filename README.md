# Tokenomy AI Toolkit

Tokenomy provides a suite of interactive tools for analyzing and optimizing large language model (LLM) workloads. The application is built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and Vite.

## Features

- **Token Calculator** – estimate token counts and costs for multiple models
- **Speed Simulator** – visualize token generation speeds across providers
- **Memory Calculator** – plan memory requirements for complex prompts
- **Energy Usage Estimator** – approximate environmental impact and electricity costs
- **AI Content Detector** – identify whether text was likely generated by an AI system. Now includes a simplified check for [Google SynthID](https://ai.google.dev/responsible/docs/safeguards/synthid) watermarks inspired by the [synthid-text](https://github.com/google-deepmind/synthid-text) project.
  Supports direct text input as well as uploading common text-based files.
- **GPU Token Throughput Monitor** – track tokens processed per GPU at `/gpu-monitoring`
- **Additional utilities** – model comparison charts, tokenization info and prompt optimization tips

## Getting Started

1. Install Node.js and npm.
2. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Visit `http://localhost:8080` to view the app.

The AI news ticker fetches updates from `/ai-news.json` by default. You can
provide your own API endpoint by setting the `VITE_NEWS_API_URL` environment
variable when starting the dev server or building the project.

### Other Scripts

- `npm run build` – create an optimized production build
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint on the project

## Tech Stack

## Data Notes

Model pricing and performance data are approximate. The values in this
repository reflect public information available around **May&nbsp;2025**. If newer
pricing or model statistics become available, update `src/lib/modelData.ts` to
keep calculations current.

## GPU Monitoring

This repository also contains a lightweight GPU throughput monitor.

- **Exporter** – run the Go metrics exporter:

  ```sh
  go run ./gpu-monitor/exporter
  ```

- **API** – start the FastAPI service:

  ```sh
  uvicorn gpu-monitor.api.app:app
  ```

The React UI is served from `/gpu-monitoring`. For a complete deployment,
see the Helm chart under `helm/gpu-monitor`.
